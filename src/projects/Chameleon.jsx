                a non-verbal conversational robot that communicates only through movement, 
                light â€” no screens, no voices, just expressive body language.

                a robot that attaches to the body and reacts to movement.

                a robot that as your needy companion, with its own temper.

            <h2>Brainstorming</h2>
            <p>
                In the brainstorming stage, our team have used low-fi sketching 
                to convey how it would look when people wear it, 
                as well as showing to peers our concept for them to critique.
            </p>
            <p>
                And we also use parallel design during the initial stage of design. 
                The final concept was the convergence of two parallel ideas -- the 
                needy robot and the wearable robot on your neck.

            <h2>Prototyping</h2>
            <h3>Low-Fi</h3>
            <p>
                we use cardboard to quickly prototype the shape and size of the robot,
                And we also use strings and cardboard for the tail to simulate the mechanism.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the light, we use simple LED lights, arduino circuit to simulate the light effect
                with chameleon's mood changes.
